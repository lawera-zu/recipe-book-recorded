1 English cucumber (or 6-8 small pickling cucumbers)
1/4 tsp salt
150 ml sour cream
1 tbsp of fresh dill
Squeeze of a lemon
Pinch of pepper

Wash and peel the cucumber. Slice thin. Add salt and let sit for 10 minutes.

After 10 min, drain any water that may have accumulated.

In the healthy version you can add greek yoghurt instead of sour cream. You will lose a lot though ;)
